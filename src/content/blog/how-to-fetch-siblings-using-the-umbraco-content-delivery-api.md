# How To Fetch Siblings Using The Umbraco Content Delivery API

I stumbled across a problem when trying to fetch sibling nodes in an Astro site using the Content Delivery API in Umbraco. Unfortunately, there didnâ€™t seem to be any straight forward way to retrieve them using the available query parameters. 

Not to worry, I have a solution! ðŸ™Œ

You may have a different way of interacting with the Content Delivery API but for this example we will do a standard fetch request.

```js
const UMBRACO_DOMAIN = 'https://example.com';
const id = '59e00b11-23d7-4d8d-af38-df7e74132036'; // id of the current node

const ancestor = await fetch(
  `${UMBRACO_DOMAIN}/umbraco/delivery/api/v2/content?fetch=ancestors:${id}&take=1`
).then(async (res) => {
  const data = await res.json();
  return data.items[0];
});

const siblings = await fetch(
  `${UMBRACO_DOMAIN}/umbraco/delivery/api/v2/content?fetch=children:${ancestor.id}`
).then(async (res) => {
  const data = await res.json();
  return data.items.filter((node) => node.id !== id);
});
```

We use the ID of the current node to fetch the ancestors, and only take 1 as thatâ€™s all weâ€™ll need to retrieve the siblings. Then we get the siblings by fetching the children by passing in the `ancestor.id`.

We can choose not to return the current node by filtering the result.

I hope this helps you understand how we can fetch sibling nodes using the Umbraco Content Delivery API!
